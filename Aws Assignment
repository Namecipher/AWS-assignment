1.What is cloud Computing??
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
2. What are the different types of cloud based on service and deployment? 
Different types of cloud computing deployment models are:
1.	Public cloud 
2.	Private cloud
3.	Hybrid cloud
4.	Community cloud
5.	Multi-cloud
3. What is scaling?? 
Scaling in cloud computing refers to the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand
4. What are the different types of scaling? Explain
 Two types of scaling are Vertical scaling and Horizontal scaling.
Vertical scaling : With vertical scaling, you can add or subtract resources, including memory or storage, within the server, as long as the resources do not exceed the capacity of the machine.
Horizontal scaling :  Horizontal scaling refers to adding more servers to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling. This method tends to take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together, handle traffic efficiently and execute concurrent workloads.
5. What are the advantages of Cloud??
